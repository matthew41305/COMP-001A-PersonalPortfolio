    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <div>I am a gamer who first got into computers because of my cousin,
        he taught me how to build, play, and understand coding languages at a basic
        level. From there I took it upon myself to pursue something higher in education
        where I now take the full stack for coding.

    <h6>Project C</h6>
    <div>I've created Shopify websites featuring a variety of products. The first one I launched was PortaPump, a portable pocket-sized air pump, it offered features
        such as; on-the-go pumping, a mini light, and several USB plug-ins to charge your phone. The second one was a supplement called VigorAide, composed of different mushrooms
        such as Lion's Mane and alpha GPC to induce better focus and overall brain health.
